  Meny         		EMCCOM .  was a three year VINNOVA financed FFI project within the Vehicle Development program. EMCCOM started 2012-09-14 and ended 2015-06-30. The project had a total budget of 7 3 MSEK. Partners in the project were Volvo Cars  Volvo AB  Provinn AB  FOI Swedish Defence Research Agency and SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden.EMCCOM has developed new EMC test methods for vehicle electronic units and simulation models .  Both to be used to protect the performance (both reliability and capacity) of wireless digital communication services in vehicles and by that ensure high availability of implemented safety and transport efficiency functions. Questions that were addressed in the project include:Systems that have been studied are 3G  4G  GNSS (GPS)  WLAN (802.11g)  C-ITS (802.11p). The results have shown that:The result of the project will be used in the work to update existing international standards aiming at the protection of radio receivers on board vehicles. In fact  the project has given input to the standardisation working group CISPR/D/WG2 in the form of a white paper.In the beginning of 2012  when the application for EMCCOM was written  Volvo Cars and Volvo AB for a longer time had experienced the need of deeper knowledge about how electromagnetic emissions from modern vehicle electronics degrade the different wireless communication systems used in vehicles. Modern vehicles contain several different broadcasting and communication radio systems that are used both for entertainment and vehicle functions. In Figure 1  an example of different systems used in a Volvo car now or in the near future is shown.The development goes towards more complex safety functions and autonomous vehicles. Examples of such functions are the Use Cases described at the Car-2-Car communication consortium home page (https://www.car-2-car.org):Functions like these require information from “off board sensors”  sensors not located in the vehicle itself. These sensors can be positioned on other vehicles or in the infrastructure close to or far away from the vehicle. In order to maintain high availability of functions  communication link performance metrics such as range and signal delay have to be addressed to a higher degree than in traditional entertainment broadcasting radio systems. In order to increase the knowledge  develop new requirements and test methods as well as low complexity simulation models to be able to predict how the link performance is affected by electromagnetic emissions from the vehicle electronics  the EMCCOM project was started.In the EMCCOM project  measurements were conducted on several digital radio systems with the aim to find acceptable interference levels at the radio receiver input. Several different types of interference signals were used as test signals. Measurements were performed on the following systems and frequencies:The highest modulation and lowest code rate were used as a basis for our measurements. The philosophy behind this was that the vehicle shall not degrade the potential of the communication technology. If the performance is degraded  it shall be due to other factors than emissions from on-board vehicle electronics. The acceptable interference level was determined in the following way;In order to have a well-defined measurement setup we have used a conducted measurement setup  as shown in Fig. 3. In principal  the same setup has been used for all tested radio systems. For GPS and C-ITS the Communication Tester was changed to a GPS simulator and a Transmitting IEEE 802.11p node respectively. The measurements are static in the sense that fading is not included.The tested interference signals are defined in Table 3.The measured quantity was the acceptable level  in dBμV  at the input of the radio receiver  as defined above. In order to compute the component requirements as in IEC CISPR 25  in dBμV/m  we have used the antenna factor for a quarter wavelength monopole. We have used this antenna factor for all frequencies. The rational for this choice is that this is the “best possible” antenna for vehicle applications and is normally the design goal when designing an automotive antenna. The antenna factor we have used is thus given by equation (1);The acceptable voltage at the receiver input calculated as above then becomes:Based on vehicle limits above and using the antenna factor in (1)  the corresponding component limits become:It should be noted that the IEEE 802.11p radio used in our measurements was a prototype based on a modified IEEE 802.11a transceiver.Correlation between measured amplitude of the interference signal  I  and the probability of error (BLER or PER) was calculated for Peak-  RMS- and Average-detector.A measurement bandwidth of 20 MHz has been used during the measurements. Recommendation is to use:    Make sure your knowledge is always up to date. Every week we publish an EMC question.

The System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structure for system development. Its purpose is to manage the development process and implement security at each stage of the development process. The principal elements of the SDLC are listed in “Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems” (SP 800-14  National Institute of Standards and Technology  September 1996) and “Security Considerations in the Information System Development Life Cycle” (SP 800-64  National Institute of Standards and Technology  September  October 2003).The five stages of the SDLC are listed in NIST SP 800-14 as follows:Only members can view the answer to this question.Register For Free Now! | Already a Member Login HereGet the Cybrary app for Android for online and offline viewing of our lessons.

"The life cycle model is one of the key concepts of systems engineering (SE).  A life cycle  for a system  generally consists of a series of stages  regulated by a set of management decisions which confirm that the system is mature enough to leave one stage and enter another.  Each part of the SEBoK is divided into knowledge areas (KAs)  which are groupings of information with a related theme. The KAs in turn are divided into topics. This KA contains the following topics:  See the article Matrix of Implementation Examples for a mapping of case studies and vignettes included in Part 7 to topics covered in Part 3. The Generic Life Cycle Model shows just the single-step approach for proceeding through the stages of a system’s life cycle.  Adding value (as a product  a service  or both)  is a shared purpose among all enterprises  whether public or private  for profit or non-profit. Value is produced by providing and integrating the elements of a system into a product or service according to the system description and transitioning it into productive use. These value considerations will lead to various forms of the generic life cycle management approach in Figure 1. Some examples are as follows (Lawson 2010): Within these examples  there are systems that remain stable over reasonably long periods of time and those that change rapidly. The diversity represented by these examples and their processes illustrate why there is no one-size-fits-all process that can be used to define a specific systems life cycle. Management and leadership approaches must consider the type of systems involved  their longevity  and the need for rapid adaptation to unforeseen changes  whether in competition  technology  leadership  or mission priorities. In turn  the management and leadership approaches impact the type and number of life cycle models that are deployed as well as the processes that will be used within any particular life cycle. There are several incremental and evolutionary approaches for sequencing the life cycle stages to deal with some of the issues raised above.  The Life Cycle Models knowledge area summarizes a number of incremental and evolutionary life cycle models  including their main strengths and weaknesses and also discusses criteria for choosing the best-fit approach. The Generic System Life Cycle Model in Figure 1 does not explicitly fit all situations.  A simple  precedential  follow-on system may need only one phase in the definition stage  while a complex system may need more than two.  With build-upon (vs. throwaway) prototypes  a good deal of development may occur during the definition stage.  System integration  verification  and validation may follow implementation or acquisition of the system elements.  With software test-first and daily builds in particular  integration  verification  and validation are interwoven with element implementation.   Additionally  with the upcoming Third Industrial Revolution of three-dimensional printing and digital manufacturing (Whadcock 2012)  not only initial development but also initial production may be done during the concept stage.   Software is a flexible and malleable medium which facilitates iterative analysis  design  construction  verification  and validation to a greater degree than is usually possible for the purely physical components of a system. Each repetition of an iterative development model adds material (code) to the growing software base  in which the expanded code base is tested  reworked as necessary  and demonstrated to satisfy the requirements for the baseline. Software can be electronically bought  sold  delivered  and upgraded anywhere in the world within reach of digital communication  making its logistics significantly different and more cost-effective than hardware.  It doesn’t wear out and its fixes change its content and behavior  making regression testing more complex than with hardware fixes.  Its discrete nature provides that its testing cannot count on analytic continuity as with hardware.  Adding 1 to 32767 in a 15-bit register does not produce 32768  but 0 instead  as experienced in serious situations  such as with the use of the Patriot Missile. There are a large number of potential life cycle process models. They fall into three major categories: The emergence of integrated  interactive hardware-software systems made pre-specified processes potentially harmful  as the most effective human-system interfaces tended to emerge with its use  leading to further process variations  such as soft SE (Warfield 1976  Checkland 1981) and human-system integration processes (Booher 2003  Pew and Mavor 2007).  Until recently  process standards and maturity models have tried to cover every eventuality and have included extensive processes for acquisition management  source selection  reviews and audits  quality assurance  configuration management  and document management  which in many instances would become overly bureaucratic and inefficient.  This led to the introduction of more lean (Ohno 1988; Womack et al. 1990; Oppenheim 2011) and agile (Beck 1999; Anderson 2010) approaches to concurrent hardware-software-human factors approaches such as the concurrent vee models (Forsberg 1991; Forsberg 2005) and Incremental Commitment Spiral Model (Pew and Mavor 2007; Boehm and Lane 2007). In the next article on System Life Cycle Process Drivers and Choices  these variations on the theme of life cycle models will be identified and presented. Regardless of the life cycle models deployed  the role of the systems engineer encompasses the entire life cycle of the system-of-interest. Systems engineers orchestrate the development and evolution of a solution  from defining requirements through operation and ultimately until system retirement. They assure that domain experts are properly involved  all advantageous opportunities are pursued  and all significant risks are identified and  when possible  mitigated. The systems engineer works closely with the project manager in tailoring the generic life cycle  including key decision gates  to meet the needs of their specific project.  Systems engineering tasks are usually concentrated at the beginning of the life cycle; however  both commercial and government organizations recognize the need for SE throughout the system’s life cycle. Often this ongoing effort is to modify or change a system  product or service after it enters production or is placed in operation. Consequently  SE is an important part of all life cycle stages. During the production  support  and utilization (PSU) stages  for example  SE executes performance analysis  interface monitoring  failure analysis  logistics analysis  tracking  and analysis of proposed changes. All of these activities are essential to ongoing support of the system.  All project managers must ensure that the business aspect (cost  schedule  and value) and the technical aspect of the project cycle remain synchronized. Often  the technical aspect drives the project and it is the systems engineers’ responsibility to ensure that the technical solutions that are being considered are consistent with the cost and schedule objectives. This can require working with the users and customers to revise objectives to fit within the business bounds. These issues also drive the need for decision gates to be appropriately spaced throughout the project cycle. Although the nature of these decision gates will vary by the major categories above  each will involve in-process validation between the developers and the end users. In-process validation asks the question: “Will what we are planning or creating satisfy the stakeholders’ needs?” In-process validation begins at the initialization of the project during user needs discovery and continues through daily activities  formal decision gate reviews  final product or solution delivery  operations  and ultimately to system closeout and disposal.

Although systems engineering is not discussed  it is clearly illustrated in the whole process from early project definition to alternate concept development to phased exploration and “thought experiments” to addressing challenges along the way. It also shows the problem of not anticipating critical problems outside the usual project and engineering scope. It took about five years to locate and recover the 24 tons of gold bars and coins from the sunken ship in the 2 500-meter-deep sea  but it took ten years to win the legal battle with the lawyers representing insurance companies who claimed ownership based on 130-year-old policies they issued to the gold owners in 1857.  McCullough  D. 1977. The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal (1870 – 1914). New York  NY  USA: Simon & Schuster.Although “systems engineering” is not mentioned  this book highlights many systems engineering issues and illustrates the need for SE as a discipline. The book also illustrates the danger of applying a previously successful concept (the sea level canal used in Suez a decade earlier) in a similar but different situation. Ferdinand de Lesseps led both the Suez and Panama projects. It illustrates the danger of not having a fact-based project cycle and meaningful decision gates throughout the project cycle. It also highlights the danger of providing project status without visibility  since after five years into the ten-year project investors were told the project was more than 50 percent complete when in fact only 10 percent of the work was complete. The second round of development under Stevens in 1904 focused on “moving dirt” rather than digging a canal  a systems engineering concept key to the completion of the canal. The Path Between the Seas won the National Book Award for history (1978)  the Francis Parkman Prize (1978)  the Samuel Eliot Morison Award (1978)  and the Cornelius Ryan Award (1977).

"The life cycle model is one of the key concepts of systems engineering (SE).  A life cycle  for a system  generally consists of a series of stages  regulated by a set of management decisions which confirm that the system is mature enough to leave one stage and enter another.  Each part of the SEBoK is divided into knowledge areas (KAs)  which are groupings of information with a related theme. The KAs in turn are divided into topics. This KA contains the following topics:  See the article Matrix of Implementation Examples for a mapping of case studies and vignettes included in Part 7 to topics covered in Part 3. The Generic Life Cycle Model shows just the single-step approach for proceeding through the stages of a system’s life cycle.  Adding value (as a product  a service  or both)  is a shared purpose among all enterprises  whether public or private  for profit or non-profit. Value is produced by providing and integrating the elements of a system into a product or service according to the system description and transitioning it into productive use. These value considerations will lead to various forms of the generic life cycle management approach in Figure 1. Some examples are as follows (Lawson 2010): Within these examples  there are systems that remain stable over reasonably long periods of time and those that change rapidly. The diversity represented by these examples and their processes illustrate why there is no one-size-fits-all process that can be used to define a specific systems life cycle. Management and leadership approaches must consider the type of systems involved  their longevity  and the need for rapid adaptation to unforeseen changes  whether in competition  technology  leadership  or mission priorities. In turn  the management and leadership approaches impact the type and number of life cycle models that are deployed as well as the processes that will be used within any particular life cycle. There are several incremental and evolutionary approaches for sequencing the life cycle stages to deal with some of the issues raised above.  The Life Cycle Models knowledge area summarizes a number of incremental and evolutionary life cycle models  including their main strengths and weaknesses and also discusses criteria for choosing the best-fit approach. The Generic System Life Cycle Model in Figure 1 does not explicitly fit all situations.  A simple  precedential  follow-on system may need only one phase in the definition stage  while a complex system may need more than two.  With build-upon (vs. throwaway) prototypes  a good deal of development may occur during the definition stage.  System integration  verification  and validation may follow implementation or acquisition of the system elements.  With software test-first and daily builds in particular  integration  verification  and validation are interwoven with element implementation.   Additionally  with the upcoming Third Industrial Revolution of three-dimensional printing and digital manufacturing (Whadcock 2012)  not only initial development but also initial production may be done during the concept stage.
